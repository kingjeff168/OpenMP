Use OpenMP to approximate the value of 𝜋 using a Monte Carlo method. 
Essentially, the program generates random points in the square bounded by (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). 
The program will count the number of points within the quarter of a unit circle centered at the origin. 
Finally, it will form the ratio of the number of points within the unit circle to the total number of points and multiply by 4, and this value approximates 𝜋.
